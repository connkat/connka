# Hey! I'm Kat, aka Connkat

First thing's first: Here is my current [Resume](https://github.com/connkat/Resume/blob/master/July18.pdf).

### History 

I am a developer based of out Calgary, AB, but I've had many careers before finally finding myself here. I completed my Bachelor's Degree in Environmental Sustainability in 2012, upgraded my BA to a BAH in 2014, and then graduated from my Masters of Public Policy program in 2015. 

Being a teenager in 2006 meant one thing: MySpace. I started my life-long love for creating by figuring out how to manipulate the HTML and CSS and sold custom layouts to friends for $20 each. Once the MySpace age came to an end, I forgot all about the tech side and focused on learning photoshop and design for fun. 

After working in politics for a few years, I kept thinking about how most of the tasks that my coworkers and I were doing could easily be automated. In the evenings after work I started to teach myself how to code basic JS. Shortly after that, I was laid off when a new party came into power so I took my severance and signed up for Lighthouse Labs' Fullstack Web Development Bootcamp. 

After being consistently successful but in school and in my previous career, my imposter syndrome upon entering the workforce as a developer was high. I initally turned down opportunities as a develop and instead worked with Lighthouse Labs' to boost their presence in Alberta. While working for LHL, I helped students transition to tech and even did code reviews to help them on their journey to becoming a developer. It was in that process that I finally had the confidence to start working as a developer. 

I joined [Neo Financial](http://neofinancial.com) back in 2019 when it just 20 people working out of a cramped coworking space, and helped grow the team with some of the other early joiners. Just over a year into my time there as a developer, I spearheaded an onboarding program to help grow our team as we took on larger work. I created a sandbox environment and taught all new developers (junior to senior) Neo's techstack and specific code patterns over the course of a week and saw over 50 developers go through my program. I decided to leave Neo in the summer of 2021 to put my focus back on development over management. 


### Today

My Github Page looks a little bare. In the 2 years I was at Neo, most of my spare dev time trying to build interesting tools related to my dayjob. Because of the nature of it being a bank, a lot of the coding that I did was exclusively contained within private repos. While I spent my first year+ working on product features (everything randing from DB management to infra to building FE clients), I spent my last 6 months at Neo building DX projects and really loved it. I made many single page apps, slack bots, and upgrades to our existing CLI tool to help our developer team have a better experience.

I am currently mentoring the full stack web dev bootcamp for [Lighthouse Labs](http://lighthouselabs.ca) and taking on some small contracts on the side while running my hiking badge business [Rocky Mountain Merit Co.](http://rockymountainmerit.co).
