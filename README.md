# Hey! I'm Kat, aka Connkat

First thing's first: This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### History 

I am a developer based of out Calgary, AB, but I've had many careers before finally finding myself here. I completed my Bachelor's Degree in Environmental Sustainability in 2012, upgraded my BA in 2014, and then graduated from my Masters of Public Policy program in 2015. 

Being a teenager in 2006 meant one thing: MySpace. I started my life-long love for creating by figuring out how to manipulate the HTML and CSS and sold custom layouts to friends for $20. Once the MySpace age came to an end, I forgot all about the tech side and focused on learning photoshop and design for fun. 

After working in politics for a few years, I kept thinking about how most of the tasks that my coworkers and I were doing could easily be automated. In the evenings after work I started to teach myself how to code basic JS. Shortly after that, I was laid off when a new party came into power so I took my severance and signed up for Lighthouse Labs' Fullstack Web Development Bootcamp. 

I really sucked at it. It took me quite a while to figure out how to learn to be a real developer (if I can even call myself that yet), but now I am working as a Software Engineer for [Neo Financial](http://neofinancial.com) and loving every minute of it. 


### Today

My Github Page looks a little bare. I spend most of my spare dev time trying to build interesting apps related to DX at my dayjob. Because of the nature of it being a bank, a lot of the coding that I do is exclusively contained within private repos for security.
